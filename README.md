Team Spondylosis at CTC14

This team was exploring various ways of scanning skeletons in order to capture available information before they are later re-interred. They used various apps on mobiles and laptops to see which combinations worked best for various devices so that the outputs could later be used by the unity burial team.

Documentation, and links to 3d models, to follow.
